<h4>Description</h4>
To use the player visualization system. You first must enter a event name done by a drop down. This list is alphabetically sorted.
<br>
After that, you have to enter in a match id. There is no other way to find a match, you will just have to guess and check until you find the one you want.
<br>
Finally, you can then select a map for that match and you will be able to see the visualized data.
<br>
You will be able to see KDA and ADR for all ten players for that map/match.
